Things to set up when having a server and a domain name
-------------------------------------------------------

Mail
----

Configuration on the server:

1. Edit /etc/postfix/main.cf:

   - set 'myhostname' to your main domain.
   - add your domain names to 'mydestination'.

2. Restart postfix: sudo /etc/init.d/postfix restart

3. Check the SNMP hostname:

    $ telnet localhost 25
    [...]
    220 mydomain.com ESMTP Postfix
    quit

Configuration on the name server of the server provider (e.g. Hetzner):

1. Set your main domain as the reverse DNS URL:

   With Hetzner: Reverse DNS Entries can only be created via the corresponding
   Robot function (menu item "Server" -> click on the server -> "IPs" -> click
   on the text field at right next to the desired IP address).

Configuration on the name server of the domain provider (e.g. No-IP):

1. Set MX record as "mydomain.com".
2. Set SPF record as "v=spf1".

Troubleshooting
---------------

Relay access denied:

    The server denies the email delivery with the following text:
    
        "554 554 5.7.1 <hcs@exponwords.com>: Relay access denied (state 14)"

    The solution is to set 'mydestination' in the postfix configuration file
    correctly.

Some email servers won't accept email from my server:
 
    Some email undelivered and sent back with the following error message:

        550 Access denied - Invalid HELO name (See RFC2821 4.1.1.1) (in reply
        to MAIL FROM command)

    Some other email undelivered and sent back with the following error message:

    Client host rejected: You have mass IP pool like reverse in DNS, fix it or
    use smtp relay from your provider. (in reply to RCPT TO command)

    Solution: hopefully to set the reverse DNS lookup correctly.
