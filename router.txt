How do I reset the ESR-1220 back to factory default settings?
Timing is very important when resetting the ESR-1220.

1.  Unplug the power from the ESR-1220.

2.  Plug the power back into the ESR-1220 and count 30 seconds.  At 30 seconds
hold down the reset button located next to the Ethernet port for 10 seconds and
release.

3.  The ESR-1220 will take 45 seconds to reboot after the reset button is
released.  Once the device has finished rebooting, you should be able to access
the GUI by typing the defualt IP address 192.168.1.1 in your web browser.  User
name and password are both "admin".
