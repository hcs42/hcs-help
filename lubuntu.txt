Autostart
---------

Method 1:

    Create a .desktop file in ~/.config/autostart/

Method 2:

    Create a ~/.config/lxsession/Lubuntu/autostart file and add the name of
    your program (with the parameters, after at @ sign) here. You cannot do
    redirections in this file.

Both methods work with bash scripts.
